//this class combines Complementary Ions into complementary clusters
    //in this class, also the calculations regarding the complementary ion signal intensities are carried out
    //in total, the following information has to be made accessible to proceed with the .csv creation process
//[0] Modified Peptide - provided in CSVAnalyzer
//[1] Precursor Mass - provided in CSVAnalyzer
//[2] Precursor Charge State - provided in CSVAnalyzer
//[3] Scan Number
//[4] Leading Proteins - provided in CSVAnalyzer
//[5] Complementary Ion Cluster Pair
//[6] Fragment Ion Amino Acid Sequence
//[7] Unadjusted Intensity SOT180c
//[8] Unadjusted Intensity SOT179c
//[9] Intensity SOT180c
//[10] Intensity SOT179c
//[11] ratio SOT179c/SOT180c

    //this class should also be able to generate a complete String to feed to the Stringbuilder
